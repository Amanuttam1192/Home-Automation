# Home-Automation
A Project using arduino_uno which helps in controlling A.C Current through mobile phone.
Components:
• Arduino uno
• 4 Channel Isolated 5V 10A Relay Module
• HC05 Bluetooth module
• Incandescent bulbs x4
• Bulb holders
• Wires
• Jump wires

Discription of the project
A simple relay project working on the programming of Arduino
processing unit,that can control the flow of ac current through a 
Bluetooth enabled device.
Here we are using a 4 channel relay so that we can control a 
maximum of 4 ac appliances at a point of time.
